## 第五章　影像復原與重建
- Things which we see are not by themselves what we see. It remains completely unknown to us what the objects may be by themselves and apart from the receptivity of our senses. We know nothing but our manner of perceiving them. (Immanuel Kant)
## 第六章　彩色影像處理
- It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color—not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression. Henri Matisse For a long time I limited myself to one color—as a form of discipline. (Pablo Picasso)
## 第七章　小波和多解析度處理
- All this time, the guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera glass. (Lewis Carrol, Through the Looking Glass)
## 第八章　影像壓縮
- But life is short and information endless Abbreviation is a necessary evil and the abbreviator’s business is to make the best of a job which, although intrinsically bad, is still better than nothing. (Aldous Huxley)
## 第九章　形態學影像處理
- In form and feature, face and limb, I grew so like my brother That folks got taking me for him And each for one another. (Henry Sambrooke Leigh, Carols of Cockayne, The Twins)
## 第十章　影像分割
- The whole is equal to the sum of its parts. (Euclid) 
- The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. (Max Wertheimer)
## 第十一章　表示與描述
- Well, but reflect; have we not several times acknowledged that names rightly given are the likenesses and images of the things which they name? (Socrates)
## 第十二章　物體辨識
- One of the most interesting aspects of the world is that it can be considered to be made up of patterns. A pattern is essentially an arrangement. It is characterized by the order of the elements of which it is made, rather than by the intrinsic nature of these elements. (Norbert Wiener)
